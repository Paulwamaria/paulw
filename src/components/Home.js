                    I am a passionate full-stack developer with experience in
                    the software development life cycle. From design,
                    development, to production, I have familiarized myself with
                    tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Python, Javascript,
                    Django, React, Flask, Angular, React-redux among others. I
                    am also comfortable creating and consuming APIs. Recently, I
                    have developed a keen interest in cloud services. Exercising
                    is my way of decompressing. If I am not coding, or by any
                    chance, if I need to get away from the bugs for a while,
                    youâ€™ll either find me in the dojo kicking and punching or on
                    a yoga mat stretching. I consider having a growth mindset as
                    my greatest asset because it compels me to seek a
                    challenging and dynamic environment where I can grow.
